# Regulatory Comments Scraper

Extracts public comments on proposed Virginia regulations, as submitted to the [Virginia Regulatory Townhall](http://townhall.virginia.gov/), and saves each comment as a JSON file. It does so by parsing HTML with regular expressions, which I am totally OK with and you should be, too, because it works.

## Instructions

0. Run at the command line: `php parser.php`.
0. There is no step 2.

## To Do

* Stop parsing HTML with regular expressions. Sure, it works *now*, but let's be realistic here.
